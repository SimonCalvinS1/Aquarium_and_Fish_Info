      <li>
        You should change about 15 to 25% of your aquarium water every one to
        two weeks.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you change your aquarium water, you should clean the rest of the
        tank as well.
      </li>
      <li>
        The percentage of water and frequency of water changes depend on the
        volume of fish and plant life in your tank.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changing the water in your tank is the most important maintenance you
        can perform on your aquarium, so following a regular schedule will
        greatly benefit the health and quality of life of your marine life.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure all pumps, filters, and lights are working properly.</li>
      <li>
        Observe fishes for negative side effects. If any side effects are
        evident, test the water immediately. If the water is fine but the fish
        remain ill, check the filters and pumps for any malfunctions.
      </li>
      <li>Remove excess food from the tank.</li>
      <li>
        Check the water temperature. Ensure that the temperature of your tank is
        suitable for all of your marine life.
      </li>
